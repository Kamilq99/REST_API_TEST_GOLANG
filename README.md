### Application Description

This application is a simple web application that combines a frontend built with HTML and a backend developed in Go (Golang). The main functionality of the application is to fetch a list of books from the backend and display them on the frontend.

#### Key Features:

1. **Frontend**:
   - The frontend is implemented using a straightforward HTML script that provides a user-friendly interface. 
   - It displays a list of books retrieved from the backend, allowing users to view details such as the title, author, and reading status of each book.

2. **Backend**:
   - The backend is developed using Go, a modern programming language known for its efficiency and performance. 
   - It serves as an API that handles requests for book data. The backend is designed to provide a list of books in JSON format, which the frontend can easily consume.

3. **Data Handling**:
   - The application maintains a predefined list of books, which includes essential information such as:
     - **ID**: A unique identifier for each book.
     - **Title**: The title of the book.
     - **Author**: The author of the book.
     - **Already Read**: A boolean indicating whether the book has been read.

4. **Interaction**:
   - Upon loading the frontend, a request is sent to the backend to retrieve the list of books.
   - The retrieved data is dynamically rendered on the webpage, allowing users to see the available books at a glance.

5. **Technology Stack**:
   - **Frontend**: HTML
   - **Backend**: Go (Golang)
   - **Web Server**: Nginx (for serving static files)

#### Conclusion

This simple application effectively demonstrates the integration of a Go-based backend with a basic HTML frontend, showcasing how to fetch and display data in a web environment. Its clear structure and simplicity make it a great starting point for learning web development and API integration.
